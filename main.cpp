//That's exciting! Since you're starting on the project, we can break down each section and decide on a clear path forward. Hereâ€™s a suggested starting outline based on the earlier idea:
//
//1. Set Up the Data Structure
//Define the Athlete struct to hold relevant data (e.g., id, name, event, race_time, country).
//Set up a vector or array to hold the athlete data.
//2. Data Loading Function
//Implement a function to read from a CSV file or similar data source and populate your Athlete data structure.
//We can start with sample data to test functionality before moving on to the full dataset.
//3. Sorting Algorithms
//Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort with a comparator function to sort by race_time (or any chosen metric).
//Add options for both ascending and descending order if needed.
//4. Command-Line UI
//Create a menu-driven UI to load data, select sorting methods, display results, and save to a file.
//Would you like to start with any specific part, such as setting up the data structure or writing the data loading function? Or do you want to dive straight into the sorting algorithms? Let me know where you'd like guidance!
